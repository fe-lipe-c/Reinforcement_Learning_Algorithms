# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This repository contains Reinforcement Learning algorithms presented in the book [Reinforcement Learning Algorithms with Python](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-with-Python).
In general, the codes are not the same, mainly because the book uses Tensorflow 1, while I try to use Tensorflow 2.

## Chapter 5

For the training in the DQN algorithm I used some ideas from [this publication](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-a-powerful-dqn-in-tensorflow-2-0-explanation-tutorial-d48ea8f3177a).
